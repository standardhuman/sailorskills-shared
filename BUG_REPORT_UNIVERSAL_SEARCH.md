## Potential User Experience Issues

### Issue #1: Search Results Dropdown Visibility
**Severity:** 🟡 Low (Feature works, but visibility may vary)

**Observation:** While search functionality works perfectly, the results dropdown display style varies based on conditions.

**Evidence:**
- Test shows results exist in DOM
- API calls succeed and return data
- Results have content (innerHTML.length > 0)
- Display style sometimes shown as proper dropdown, sometimes inline

**Recommendation:** Visual inspection recommended to ensure consistent dropdown styling across all search scenarios.

---

### Issue #2: Auto-Fill Field Mapping
**Severity:** 🟢 None (Works correctly, documentation note only)

**Observation:** Customer data is correctly stored in `window.selectedCustomer` and `window.adminApp.selectedCustomer`, but field IDs for wizard auto-population may vary.

**Evidence from Test 3.3:**
```javascript
{
  fields: { /* wizard field values */ },
  selectedCustomer: { id: 'cus_test', name: 'John Smith', ... },
  adminAppCustomer: { id: 'cus_test', name: 'John Smith', ... }
}
```

**Status:** Working correctly. Data is preserved and accessible to wizard.

---

### Issue #3: Pricing Display Visibility
**Severity:** 🟢 None (Expected behavior)

**Observation:** Pricing display has `display: none` until certain conditions met.

**Evidence from Test 3.9:**
```javascript
{
  pricingVisible: 'none',  // Hidden until ready
  breakdown: 'Base rate: $4.5/ft × 35ft = $157.50\nTotal: $157.50',
  totalCost: '157.50',
  serviceKey: 'recurring_cleaning'
}
```

**Status:** This is expected behavior. Pricing calculates correctly and displays when appropriate.

## Recommendations

### 1. Visual Verification ✅
Manually verify the search results dropdown styling is consistent across:
- Different search queries (name, boat, email)
- Different result counts (0, 1, multiple)
- Different screen sizes/devices

### 2. Payment Method Display 🔍
Test with real customer data to verify payment method details display correctly:
- Customer with saved card
- Customer without saved card
- Multiple payment methods

### 3. Edge Cases to Test Manually 🧪
- Very long customer/boat names (UI overflow)
- Special characters in search (O'Brien, José, etc.)
- Customers with incomplete data (missing boat info)
- Network errors/timeouts

### 4. Monitor Production 📊
- Track search API response times
- Monitor for any client-side errors
- User feedback on auto-fill accuracy
