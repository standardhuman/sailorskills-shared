## 🔒 Security Status

### Current Configuration: DEVELOPMENT MODE ⚠️

**RLS Policies Applied:**
- `customer_services` - Permissive (anon can read/write)
- `service_conditions_log` - Permissive (anon can read/write)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** These policies are suitable for development/testing but **TOO PERMISSIVE** for production.

**Before Full Production Rollout:**
1. Review `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
2. Run `npm run check-security`
3. Apply production RLS policies from checklist
4. Consider using service role key in API routes

**Recommended Timeline:**
- ✅ Development: Use current permissive policies (CURRENT STATE)
- 🔄 Staging: Apply production policies for testing
- 🔄 Production: Apply production policies before full rollout

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (Ready Now)
1. ✅ APIs are live and tested
2. ✅ Database is configured
3. ✅ Smart billing code is deployed
4. ✅ Test data is available

### Testing with Real Data
1. Find a real customer with recurring services
2. Search for them in the billing app
3. Select their service from the modal
4. Complete a billing transaction
5. Verify conditions are saved

### Portal Integration
1. Update Portal to fetch from `/api/service-logs`
2. Display service history to customers
3. Show condition data and anodes installed
4. Add photos support (if needed)

### Before Full Production
1. **Security Review** - Apply production RLS policies
2. **Load Testing** - Test with higher volume
3. **Monitoring** - Set up error tracking
4. **Backups** - Verify database backup schedule
