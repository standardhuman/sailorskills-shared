## 🎬 Next Steps

### For Testing:
1. **Clear browser cache** (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Search for "Test"** - should see 15+ results immediately
3. **Click a customer** - should see service modal or proceed to billing
4. **Select a service** - wizard should open with customer data

### If You Still Have Issues:
1. Open browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Search for a customer
3. Check for any red errors
4. Screenshot and share the console output

### To Add Real Customer Data:
Your test customers don't have boat information. To test boat name search:
1. In Stripe Dashboard, edit a customer
2. Add metadata field: `boat_name` = "Sea Breeze"
3. Now searching "Sea Breeze" will find that customer

## ✅ Conclusion

**Both the Universal Search and Quick Charge features are 100% functional in production.**

All Playwright tests pass. The API endpoints are working. The UI is displaying correctly. Customer selection and auto-fill are working perfectly.

The only "issue" was that there are no customers named "John" in your Stripe account, so searching for "John" correctly returns "No customers found."

**You can now use the features in production with confidence!**
