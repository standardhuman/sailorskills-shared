## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Test Locally (Recommended First)

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   ./start-dev.sh
   # Or: vercel dev
   # Or: npx http-server dist -p 8001
   ```

2. **Open billing app:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8001/admin.html
   ```

3. **Test the flow:**
   - Search for "John Doe 2"
   - Service selection modal should appear
   - Select "Bill for this service"
   - Fill in condition fields
   - Add anodes (optional)
   - Charge customer (test mode)
   - Verify conditions saved

4. **Verify data saved:**
   ```bash
   node verify-migrations.js
   ```

### Option 2: Run Automated Tests

```bash
# Run all Playwright tests
npm run test:playwright

# Run only smart billing tests
npm run test:smart-billing
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Production

⚠️ **Before deploying:**

1. **Run security check:**
   ```bash
   npm run check-security
   ```

2. **Review checklist:**
   - Open `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Follow all pre-deployment steps
   - Update RLS policies for production

3. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add smart billing with condition tracking"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Post-deployment:**
   - Verify APIs work in production
   - Test with real customer
   - Check Supabase logs
   - Monitor first few transactions
